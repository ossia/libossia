ossia-max unit tests
====================

This folder contains a `logger-server.js` that loads sequentially each patcher which name ends with ".ossia-max-test.maxpat".
Those patchers should contains one or more `ossia.assert` objects and a `ossia.test-logger` object.

Please disable the "Restore Windows on Launch" Max's option to prevent Max from reloading other patchers then the one we want to test.

Each patcher runs under a fresh opened Max application.
